    "description": "Shooting a bow and arrow at a target is an art that requires lots of focus. This challenge is to draw a bow and try to hold it steady while your hand jitters...just like the other humans who have used the bow and arrow for hunting since the dawn of civilization over ten thousand years ago. The oldest known bow, found in Denmark, dates from 9000 BCE!",
