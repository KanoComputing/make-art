    "description": "No campsite is complete without a tent. We’ve got you settled with a simple fly tent, which is usually made with a tarpaulin, rope, and stakes. But with your creative powers you can transform it into whatever you want!  \nPeople have lived in tents, teepees, yurts, and wigwams for thousands of years. What features can you add to your tent to keep yourself dry and warm? You can always get inspiration from browsing other creations on Kano World, and searching the Internet for other tent designs.",
