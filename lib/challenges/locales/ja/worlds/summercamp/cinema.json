    "description": "After playing a short movie presentation by the Skladanowsky brothers in 1895 which consisted of numerous very short 6-second films accompanied by a specially composed piece of music, the Berlin Wintergarten theatre in Mitte, Berlin, became known as the first ever movie theatre. Unfortunately the theatre was destroyed by bombs in 1944, during the Second World War.",
